Project Overview
The Government Schemes Chatbot is an intelligent system that allows users to inquire about various government schemes. It processes user inputs and provides suitable responses based on predefined intents stored in the intents.json file.

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
JSON
Tkinter (for GUI)
Pickle (for serialization)
Files and Folders
chatmodel - The trained machine learning model used by the chatbot.
chatbot-gui.py - Python script providing a graphical interface for the chatbot.
intents.json - A JSON file containing intents (user queries and responses).
label_encoder.pickle - Encodes categorical labels into numerical form.
tokenizer.pickle - Pre-trained tokenizer used to convert text to tokens for the model.
train-chatbot.py - Script for training the chatbot model using data from intents.json.
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/government-schemes-chatbot.git
cd government-schemes-chatbot
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the following libraries:

TensorFlow
Keras
Numpy
Pickle
Tkinter
Train the model: Run the training script to train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train-chatbot.py
Usage
Once the model is trained, you can start the chatbot interface by running:

bash
Copy code
python chatbot-gui.py
This will launch the chatbot GUI, where you can interact with it by asking questions related to government schemes.

Customization
To add or modify the schemes and intents:

Edit the intents.json file to include new intents, patterns, and responses.
Retrain the model using the train-chatbot.py script after making changes.
Future Enhancements
Voice Input/Output: Add voice recognition and speech synthesis for a more interactive experience.
Multilingual Support: Implement support for multiple languages.
Database Integration: Store conversation logs and scheme data in a database for analytics.
